# NsySafePass

**NsySafePass** is a simple command line tool written in Python that helps you manage your passwords securely. It allows you to generate strong passwords, store them with your account information and retrieve them later when needed. All your passwords are stored in one file so you can access them at any time. The app also checks the strength of your passwords and makes sure they are secure. It's a simple but handy tool for keeping track of all your passwords in one place, and you can use it right from the terminal.

Warm regards,

Naisya Aghis, the creator of this tool.
